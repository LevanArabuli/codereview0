# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Produce code review feedback that's as useful as a senior engineer's review -- context-aware, well-prioritized, and focused on what actually matters.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Output Filtering

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Output Filtering)
Plan: 0 of 0 in current phase (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phases 1-3 are independent (no inter-dependencies), Phase 4 integrates all three
- [Roadmap]: PROMPT-01/03 separated from PROMPT-02/04 because the former are pure prompt content, the latter depend on context infrastructure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 2 context infrastructure: convention detection scoping to base-branch files is a security invariant needing careful implementation
- Research flags Phase 4 integration: agentic turn budget (MAX_AGENTIC_TURNS = 75) needs validation after adding convention detection
